## Go SQLite Structure Generator

It reads SQLite table structure and generates Golang coad to a single package per table with table name and colunm name as constant

### Usage
Run the command:
```
sqlite-table-gen <sqlite-db-path> <output-folder>
```


Primarily targeting Pocketbase users, as I find it hard to keep track of dynamic types during development
